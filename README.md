# create-cac-app

**WIP**

`create-cac-app` is a command line tool to setup a CLI structure for CLI tools
using [cac][0].

The tool is currently not generic and can be improved in many ways. For now I
am just using it to speed up time on getting started with a new CLI tool. Feel
free to send a pull request to clean it up or add things like prompt for
configuration.
